    "## 1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a software system using objects. OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. Each object encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that are related to the entity it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key principles of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: This refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., the object. Encapsulation allows data to be hidden and accessed only through well-defined methods, providing data security and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction allows the programmer to focus on essential characteristics and functionalities of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It helps in simplifying the complexity of a system, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This promotes code reusability and allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This concept allows flexibility in handling different types of objects through a uniform interface, enhancing code flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing OOP, software developers can create modular, maintainable, and scalable applications that mimic real-world entities and interactions. It fosters a more natural way of thinking about problem-solving, making it widely used in various programming languages and applications."

    "**Ans:**\n",
    "In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of variables used within a class, but they have different scopes and purposes. Let's explore the differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class variables are variables that are defined within the class but outside of any method.\n",
    "They are shared among all instances (objects) of the class. This means that any change to the class variable's value will affect all instances of the class.\n",

    "## 6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "The self parameter in Python class methods is a reference to the instance of the class (i.e., the object) on which the method is called. It is a convention in Python to name this first parameter of instance methods as self, although you can technically choose any name for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a method inside a class and call it on an object, Python automatically passes the reference to that object as the self parameter to the method. This allows the method to access and manipulate the object's attributes and call other methods associated with that specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of the self parameter is to enable the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accessing instance variables:** Inside the method, you can access and modify the object's instance variables using self.variable_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Calling other instance methods:** You can call other methods of the same class using self.method_name(). This allows methods to interact with each other and share functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Differentiating between multiple instances:** When you create multiple objects of the same class, each object has its own set of instance variables. The self parameter allows methods to operate on the specific object that called the method.\n",
