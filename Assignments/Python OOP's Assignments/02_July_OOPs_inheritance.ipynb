    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). In other words, the subclass can reuse and extend the attributes and methods of the superclass, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is represented by an \"is-a\" relationship, where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass. The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass, and it can also have its own additional attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing common attributes and methods to be defined in the superclass and inherited by multiple subclasses. This eliminates the need to rewrite the same code in different classes.\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   - Modularity: Inheritance allows developers to break down complex classes into smaller, more manageable subclasses, each focusing on specific behaviors or attributes. This improves the modularity of the code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Extensibility: Subclasses can add new functionality to the inherited methods or override them to modify their behavior according to the specific needs of the subclass. This enables the creation of specialized classes while still retaining the core functionality from the superclass.\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Polymorphism: Inheritance plays a crucial role in achieving polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. This allows for more flexible and generic code, as objects can be manipulated using a uniform interface defined in the superclass."

    "1. Single Inheritance:\n",
    "   - Single inheritance refers to a scenario where a subclass inherits from only one superclass. That means a subclass can have only one direct parent class, and it inherits all the attributes and methods of that parent class.\n",
    "   - In Python, single inheritance is achieved by specifying the superclass in the parentheses after the class name during class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "   - Multiple inheritance refers to a scenario where a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. In this case, a subclass can have more than one direct parent class, and it inherits attributes and methods from all of them.\n",
    "   - In Python, multiple inheritance is achieved by specifying multiple superclasses in the parentheses separated by commas during class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single inheritance involves one superclass and one subclass, while multiple inheritance involves multiple superclasses and one subclass.\n",
    "- In single inheritance, the class hierarchy is a simple tree structure, whereas in multiple inheritance, the class hierarchy can be more complex with a diamond-shaped inheritance structure in case of ambiguity.\n",
    "- In single inheritance, there is no risk of method name clashes, while multiple inheritance may lead to method name conflicts between superclasses, requiring method resolution rules like Method Resolution Order (MRO) to resolve the ambiguity."
